Barkus is a beloved Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans that celebrates dogs in all their furry glory. Every year, thousands of people gather on the streets of the French Quarter to watch the parade of pooches, all decked out in their finest costumes.

Barkus was first founded in 1992 by a group of dog-loving locals who wanted to create a parade just for their furry friends. The parade quickly became a hit and has been going strong ever since. Today, Barkus is one of the largest and most popular parades during Mardi Gras season, attracting both locals and tourists alike.

The parade is known for its unique themes each year, which are announced in advance to allow participants to plan their costumes accordingly. In past years, the themes have included "Bark to the Future," "Barkus Goes Tailgating," and "Pirates of the Crescent City."

The parade typically begins at Armstrong Park and winds its way through the French Quarter, with spectators lining the streets to catch a glimpse of the furry parade. The highlight of the parade is always the coronation of the Barkus King and Queen, two lucky pups chosen to lead the procession.

One of the best things about Barkus is the sense of community it fosters. The parade is open to all dogs, regardless of breed or pedigree, and many of the dogs are rescued or adopted. It's a great way for dog owners to connect and share their love for their furry companions.

In addition to the parade, Barkus also hosts a pre-parade ball, where dogs and their owners can dress up in formal attire and dance the night away. The ball is always a hit and sells out quickly, so it's important to book tickets well in advance.

Overall, Barkus is a truly unique and heartwarming celebration of dogs and their place in our lives. It's a testament to the joy and love that our furry friends bring us every day, and a reminder to cherish them always. If you're ever in New Orleans during Mardi Gras season, be sure to check out Barkus â€“ you won't be disappointed!
